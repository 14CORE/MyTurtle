Development
===========
MyTurtle is the place where you make your new turtles.

Quick start
===========
To make a new turtle:
* make a new folder in `/turtles`
* copy `/turtles/skeleton/dna.js` to the folder
* edit the dna.js file to suit your needs
* add a view to your folder

Dna.js
======
Dna.js is where all the magic happens. Here you fetch your data, parse your data and define what to do on specific events.
More details on dna.js [here](http://github.com/FlatTurtle/MyTurtle/tree/master/turtles).

Making views
============
Views are made using the [mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) templating language.
Creating them is very straight forward, therefore the easiest way to get started creating views is to look at one of the premade turtles.
The css for your new turtles can be added in a new `.scss` file in `/src/css/turtles`.

Notes
=====
* name your turtle folder the same way as you named it in the database
* do not use the client folder -> the contents of this folder are generated by ant


Important
=========
We concatenate and minify our javascript. If you're doing anything else than creating new turtles don't forget to add your new javascript files to build.xml and run "ant build"
